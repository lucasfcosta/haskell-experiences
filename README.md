# haskell-experiences
My personal repository for Haskell studies and experiences.

I'm fairly new to Functional Programming and Haskell, therefore my examples won't be so good as the ones made by Haskell pros.


## Textbook

This repository is mainly based on the book [Learn You Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com).

If you're interested into following my examples please read that.


## Getting in Touch

If you feel like you could improve my code or point out any other mistakes feel free to use [this repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/lucasfcosta/haskell-experiences/issues) to get in touch with me.

You can also contact me if you have any doubts/questions about my code.
